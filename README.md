in a more convenient and cost-effective way, via a single API.

With the [xyt hub](https://xythub.com), trading firms and exchanges can immediately access tick data and analytics,
without costly investment into in-house data infrastructure and storage, technology capable of managing tick data
with nanosecond precision and market-by-order granularity, or indeed additional staff.

The [xyt hub](https://xythub.com) connects data providers (e.g. exchanges, brokers or data vendors)
with data consumers (e.g. traders, quants or downstream systems).
